# php-api-library-core
The core code for the PHP API Library.

## Overview
The core philosophy behind the PHPAPILibrary project is to allow developers to only have to write business logic when building an API. 
Whether that API is an HTTP RESTful service, an SDK that consumes an HTTP RESTful API, or something else entirely, like a binary notification API, this project seeks to provide a universal API abstraction.
Beyond having a powerful abstraction, the PHPAPILibrary project seeks to achieve that goal through a minimalistic, modular implementation. When using this library, as few external dependencies as possible should be included. For example; if you're not building an HTTP API, you shouldn't need GuzzleHTTP.
